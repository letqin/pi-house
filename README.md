Raspberry Pi controlled greenhouse with climate monitoring and controlling systems

# What does it do?

The greenhouse itself is a mostly sealed greenhouse with multiple ways of controlling the environment inside. The monitoring systems include a soil moisture and temperature sensor as well as an ambient temperature sensor. There is a motor that controls a vent to let in outside air. A screen is covering the vent so there cannot be any foreign insects in the greenhouse. A fan inside the greenhouse will circulate the air inside when the temperature is warm enough.
