# pi-house

Raspberry Pi greenhouse with climate monitoring and controls. pi-house is an indoor greenhouse with the intention of bringing a reliable, relatively self sustaining personal garden. 

# What Does It Monitor?

The greenhouse itself is mostly sealed with multiple values for environmental conditions in the greenhouse being measured at all times. The monitoring systems include a soil moisture and temperature sensor as well as an ambient temperature sensor. A light sensor will monitor if a secondary light source is necessary (if there is a cloudy day or other weather conditions that may limit sunlight).

# What Can It Do?

There are motors that control a set of vents to let in outside air to be blown across the plants and, in turn, out of the greenhouse. A screen is covering the vents so there cannot be any foreign insects in the greenhouse. A fan inside the greenhouse circulates the air inside when the temperature is warm enough. There is also a misting watering system with a pump and tubing that goes across the top of the greenhouse.
