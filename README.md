Raspberry Pi controlled greenhouse with climate monitoring and controlling systems

# What Does It Monitor?

The greenhouse itself is a mostly sealed greenhouse with multiple ways of controlling the environment inside. The monitoring systems include a soil moisture and temperature sensor as well as an ambient temperature sensor.

# What Can It Do?

There is a motor that controls a set of vents to let in outside air to be blown across the plants and outside the greenhouse. A screen is covering the vents so there cannot be any foreign insects in the greenhouse. A fan inside the greenhouse will circulate the air inside when the temperature is warm enough.
