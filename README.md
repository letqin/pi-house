# pi-house

Raspberry Pi greenhouse with climate monitoring and controls. pi-house is an indoor greenhouse with the intention of bringing a reliable, relatively self sustaining personal garden. There will, in the future, be an outdoor version as well. 

# What Does It Keep Track Of?

The greenhouse itself is mostly sealed with multiple values for environmental conditions in the greenhouse being measured at all times. The monitoring systems include a soil moisture and temperature sensor as well as an ambient temperature sensor. A light sensor will monitor if a secondary light source is necessary (if there is a cloudy day or other weather conditions that may limit sunlight).

# What Can It Do?

* Two motors control a set of vents, letting in outside air to be blown across the plants and out.
    * Screens cover the vents so solid objects cannot freely enter the greenhouse.
    * Internal fans circulate the air inside as long as the temperature is warm enough.
    * Heat lamps will be activated if the temperature is too low.
* Mist watering system with a pump and tubing that goes across the top of the greenhouse.
    * A water tank will need to have sufficient water for the misting system to be functional. If there is insufficient water the pump will not run.
    * Opposite the vent on the top of the greenhouse, there is a manual opening for watering the plants inside.
